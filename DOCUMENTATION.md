## Core Features

### Public View

The public view provides a beautiful interface for viewing festival results:

1. **Event Switcher** - Navigate between multiple active events
2. **Team Standings** - Visual leaderboard showing team rankings
3. **Top Performers** - Highlighted list of top individual students
4. **Results Display** - Filterable and searchable results list
5. **Search & Filter** - Find specific students, teams, or programs

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive management capabilities:

1. **Dashboard Overview** - Statistics and quick actions
2. **Event Management** - Create, edit, and activate events
3. **Team Management** - Manage teams and their colors
4. **Student Management** - Register students and assign to teams
5. **Program Management** - Define competition programs
6. **Results Management** - Enter and manage competition results
7. **Points Configuration** - Configure point systems

## Data Models

### Event
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  isActive: boolean,
  themeColor: string,
  logo: string
}
```

### Team
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  color: string
}
```

### Student
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  teamId: string,
  category: string
}
```

### Program
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  type: 'individual' | 'group' | 'general',
  points: {
    '1st': number,
    '2nd': number,
    '3rd': number
  }
}
```

### Result
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  programId: string,
  studentId: string, // For individual programs
  teamId: string,    // For group programs
  position: '1st' | '2nd' | '3rd',
  grade: 'A' | 'B'
}
```

## State Management

The application uses React Context API with @nkzw/create-context-hook for state management. The main context provides:

- Current view (public/admin)
- Authentication state
- Events data
- Teams data
- Students data
- Programs data
- Results data
- Active events filtering

## Data Persistence

All data is persisted using localStorage with automatic saving whenever data changes. The application loads data from localStorage on startup, falling back to mock data if no saved data exists.

## Security

The admin panel uses a simple authentication system with hardcoded credentials (admin/admin123). This is suitable for local use but should be enhanced for production deployments.

## Performance

The application is optimized for performance with:

- Efficient state management
- Lazy loading of components
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Virtualized lists for large datasets

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the build folder to your hosting service

Supported platforms include:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Traditional web servers

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

2. **User Management** - More sophisticated authentication and authorization
3. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for live updates
4. **Export Functionality** - PDF and Excel export of results
5. **Advanced Analytics** - More detailed statistics and insights
6. **Multi-language Support** - Internationalization capabilities
7. **Dark Mode** - Theme switching for different preferences
8. **Offline Support** - Progressive Web App features for offline use
